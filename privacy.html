  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted">Last updated: 2025-10-02</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>NerdForm Labs LLC</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects,
    uses, and protects information in connection with the <strong>MuscleNerd</strong> mobile application
    and related support pages.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>
    We collect only the minimum information necessary to operate and improve the app:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Diagnostics</strong> (e.g., crash logs, performance data) to maintain reliability.</li>
    <li><strong>Basic analytics</strong> (e.g., anonymized usage events) to understand feature usage.</li>
    <li><strong>Support communications</strong> (your email and message) when you contact us voluntarily.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data. We do not collect precise location, contacts,
    or other sensitive categories unless explicitly provided by you for support.
  </p>

  <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To operate, maintain, and improve app functionality and stability.</li>
    <li>To respond to support requests and communicate with you about issues you report.</li>
    <li>To analyze anonymized trends and enhance user experience.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    We may use privacy-respecting analytics and crash reporting services (e.g., platform-standard SDKs).
    These providers process limited technical data on our behalf to deliver their services.
    Where applicable, their processing is governed by their own privacy terms.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain information only as long as necessary for the purposes described above, or as required by law.
    Support emails are kept for troubleshooting and audit history, then deleted or anonymized.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    MuscleNerd is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information
    from children. If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us
    so we can delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your information.
    However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Choices & Rights</h2>
  <p>
    You can choose not to send support emails or optional data. Where applicable by law, you may request
    access, correction, or deletion of your information by contacting us.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes on this page and update
    the “Last updated” date above.
